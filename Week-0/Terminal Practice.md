### 3.	Create a new directory, call it 'test'
#### To do that we will use mkdir command to create directory in the Desktop, then enter the folder that we just create

### 4.	Make files called index.html, style.css, commands.txt inside the test directory
#### Using touch command to give a name for the file and adding there extension , you can do that by creating them line by line or create all file in one line followed by a space!

### 5.	Make a copy of index.html and call it index_2.html
#### To use cp command correctly, at first define the file you want to copy it, create another file has the same extension.

### 6.	Navigate back to you desktop and make another directory, call it destination
#### To navigate back we use the cd command followed with two dots, and then repeat Q3.

### 7.	Move the index_2.html file to the 'destination' directory
#### to make it happen, we have first back to the test folder; because its contain the file we need to move. Then we use mv command to select the file then we write 2 dots to get out from the test folder then define the folder that we want to move the file to it.

### 8.	In the 'test' directory, remove the 'styles.css' file
#### While we are in the test folder, use rm command followed with the name of the file to delete it

### 9.	Now, check and see what files are in the 'test' and 'destination' directories
#### While we are in the test folder , we can just write ls command to show the files, for the destination folder there is two ways , first to get out from test folder and then get in destination folder then type ls command. For me I prefer to do it in one line and while we are inside test folder, to do so type ls command and then 2dots followed with direction to another folder.

### 10.	Remove/delete the 'destination' directory
#### While the destination folder has file inside, we will use -rf with rm command to delete the folder and all files inside it.

### 11.	Spend 10 minutes researching some other terminal commands and keep them in mind for the future!

### 13.	Display the contents of commands.txt in the terminal
